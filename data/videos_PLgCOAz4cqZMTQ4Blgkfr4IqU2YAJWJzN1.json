      "title": "What Grit Really Teaches Us About Happiness with Professor Angela Duckworth | A Bit of Optimism",
      "description": "We’re often told that the secret to success is grit - more discipline, more perseverance, more individual effort. And grit does matter. But what if it’s only half the story?\n\nIn today’s world, we’ve become experts at tracking achievement, yet novices at nurturing belonging - and the cost of that imbalance is showing up everywhere from burnout to loneliness.\n\nFew people are better equipped to help me make sense of that tension than today’s guest, Angela Duckworth. Angela is a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, a MacArthur “Genius” Award winner, and the bestselling author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.\n\nAngela is one of those people I could talk to for hours and we cover a lot of ground, but our conversation isn’t just about grit or performance. It’s about something deeper: why belonging gives achievement meaning and why human beings are actually wired to thrive together.\n\nIn this episode, Angela and I explore how a culture obsessed with individual success quietly erodes teamwork, trust, and wellbeing. We talk about the loneliness epidemic among young people, why grit is so often misunderstood, and why character isn’t just about what you do for yourself, but what you do for others. Along the way, we unpack why the smartest people don’t always make the best teammates, how incentives shape behavior in ways we rarely notice, and why purpose and people—not willpower—are what sustain us over time.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt burned out, disconnected, or wondered why success doesn’t feel as satisfying as you thought it would, this conversation is a reminder that meaning doesn’t come from standing alone at the top—it comes from being part of something bigger than yourself.\n\nThis is… A Bit of Optimism.\n\n---------------------------\n\nTo buy Angela’s book Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, head to: https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Grit/Angela-Duckworth/9781501111112\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "title": "Matthew McConaughey on How to Fall Back in Love with Your Life | A Bit Of Optimism",
      "description": "In a world defined by constant change, reinvention isn’t optional - it’s essential. We often assume reinvention comes from bold leaps or lucky breaks, but actor and author Matthew McConaughey’s story suggests a quieter approach can be far more powerful.\n\nIn this episode, Matthew joins me to explore the inner practices that have shaped both his life and his legendary career in Hollywood. From stepping away from romantic comedies at the height of his success to sitting with uncertainty when there were no guarantees on the other side, Matthew shares how learning to get comfortable with discomfort empowered the most meaningful reinventions of his life.\n\nAt the center of our conversation is curiosity - self-curiosity. Matthew reflects on decades of journaling as a way to notice patterns, stay honest, and make sense of moments that feel unclear. Rather than avoiding discomfort, he learned to treat it as information to study, learn from, and eventually act on.\n\nWe talk about what it takes to stay relevant without losing yourself, why reinvention often requires carrying the risk before anyone else believes in the outcome, and how self-curiosity can become a compass when the path forward isn’t obvious.\n\nMatthew also shares how these ideas come to life in his newest book, Poems & Prayers - a collection of reflections shaped by presence, patience, and the courage to keep asking better questions.\n\nIf you’re navigating change, questioning your direction, or looking to grow while remaining true to yourself, this conversation offers a grounded and thoughtful path forward.\n\nThis is… A Bit of Optimism.\n\n---------------------------\n\nTo check out Matthew’s new book Poems & Prayers, head to: http://www.poemsprayers.com\n\n---------------------------\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "Often the biggest transformations we undergo don’t arrive as lightning bolts, but as quiet shifts we’ve been preparing for all along. For John Fox, the transformation from a 25-year career in high finance to becoming a chaplain wasn’t sudden at all. It was a slow burn — shaped by loss, reflection, community, and a deep desire to live a more meaningful life.\n\nJohn’s successful finance career spanned decades. To the world, he was thriving, but internally he yearned for fulfillment no paycheck could give him. After losing his mother, questioning the purpose of work, and rediscovering his spiritual roots, he began to sense that his life was preparing him for a very different kind of service. That path eventually led him to the Peace Corps, seminary, and finally chaplaincy — where he now spends his days sitting with people in hospitals, jails, shelters, and hospice care.\n\nIn this conversation, John shares how you can slowly build a new life, why most of us struggle to talk about things we can’t fix, and the human need to be seen by others. We also talk about community, discernment, loss, faith, and the power of listening without trying to change anything.\n\nHis story is a reminder that life’s meaning often reveals itself slowly… and that the pivots that change our lives most profoundly are the ones we’ve been preparing for all along.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\n---------------------------\n\nTo learn more about the Union Rescue Mission, visit their website at www.urm.org\n\nAnd to check out John’s congregation, head to www.newcitychurchla.com\n\n---------------------------\n\nP.S.

      "description": "Life can change in an instant. One day you’re shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue, and the next you’re sitting in your car with everything you own, and everyone you love, wondering what happens now.\n\nJoan Howard grew up in Beverly Hills with every advantage until a series of crises left her homeless and living in her car with her mother and three dogs. What helped her rebuild wasn't luck or charity. It was kindness, consistency, and one simple weekly practice of being in service to others.\n\nToday, Joan is a long-time volunteer for Food on Foot, the very organization that helped her decades ago. Food on Foot is more than a meal line — it’s a community built on dignity, kindness, and practical support for people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Their model helps people find work, save money, build confidence, and move forward with independence.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about what homelessness actually looks like, why service can be transformative, and how organizations like Food on Foot help people not just get back on their feet, but build a future.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\n---------------------------\n\nTo learn more about Food on Foot, visit their website!\n\nhttps://www.foodonfoot.org/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "What if a great business was built like a handmade mixtape? A lovingly crafted experience that is as much a love letter from its founder as it is custom-tailored to its audience.\n\nBefore Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams became a household name, Jeni Britton was a 22-year-old art school dropout scooping her ice cream creations at a farmers market in Ohio. She didn’t have investors, connections, or a playbook. What she did have was a vision—not just for ice cream, but for connection.\n\nJeni believed her bold ice cream could be a conduit for something bigger: a place where people feel seen, conversations happen naturally, and strangers become community. Over the next two decades, she bootstrapped her way from a small counter to a nationally recognized brand by doing everything the slow, hard, old-fashioned way—one customer, one flavor, and one act of service at a time.\n\nShe refused shortcuts. She prioritized people. And she built her company like a handmade mixtape—crafted with intention, risk, rebellion, and love.\n\nIn this conversation, Jeni explains what true entrepreneurship really is: not hype, not hyper-growth, and not chasing venture capital, but the courage to follow a vision long enough for it to start leading you. We talk about the creative process, the power of service, the lessons learned from young employees, the myth of “scalable ideas,” and how walking in the woods helped Jeni discover her next chapter—Floura.\n\nJeni’s story is a reminder that the best things in life - and in business - take time, heart, and a willingness to make something beautiful even when no one is watching.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by the Porsche USA Macan\n---------------------------\n\nVisit Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams:\nhttps://jenis.com/\n\nCheck out Jeni’s newest venture—Floura:\nhttps://www.floura.com/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "Who would’ve guessed that one of the world’s best company cultures was hiding behind a can of WD-40? Of all the places to find a leadership masterclass, the blue-and-yellow can in your garage probably wasn’t on your list - but it’s time to put it there.\n\nGarry Ridge—an Australian who brought his charm and curiosity across the Pacific—joined WD-40 Company in the late ’80s and rose through the ranks, eventually serving as CEO for 25 years. But he didn’t start out as the culture-building expert he’s known as today. Early in his career, he lived by the old mantra: “be brilliant, be brief, be gone.” He had to unlearn that mindset and rebuild himself into a leader who centers people, learning, and belonging  - an evolution that reshaped WD-40 from the inside out. His new book, Any Dumb Ass Can Do It, captures that journey.\n\nIn this episode, we break down how Garry built a company where people genuinely love coming to work—even through recessions, pandemics, and all the external chaos leaders can’t control. We dig into the systems and behaviors that fueled WD-40’s rise, from psychological safety to accountability to building internal consistency no matter what the market is doing.\n\nGarry and I both believe that people deserve to love their work - even if they don’t like it every single day.

      "description": "What if great friendships aren’t found by luck but built through effort?\n\nBestselling novelist Fredrik Backman, the mind behind \"A Man Called Ove\" (adapted into the Tom Hanks film \"A Man Called Otto\"), \"Anxious People\", and the beloved Beartown series, has spent his career writing about the quiet power of ordinary people. But in his real life, he learned one of his most important lessons from his best friend of 30 years: meaningful friendship is a skill you develop, not a lottery you win.\n\nDespite being a self-described introvert, Fredrik discovered that you don’t need hundreds of friends. You only get a few humans who truly shape your life. His newest book, \"My Friends\", is a tribute to those relationships and the daily work of showing up for the people who matter most.\n\nIn this candid and inspiring conversation, Fredrik and I talk about the healing power of friendship, why differences make relationships stronger, the value of having friends who edit us, and the joy of being genuinely happy for someone else.\n\nIf you want to become a better friend and build deeper connections, this episode offers heartfelt lessons from one of the world’s most compassionate storytellers.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by the Porsche USA Macan\n---------------------------\n\nTo check out Fredrik’s newest book, “My Friends,” visit:\nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/My-Friends/Fredrik-Backman/9781982112820\n\nFind the full-length speech Fredrik gave for Simon & Schuster here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSuSyZ92Cjg\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "If you feel stupid while learning something new, you’re doing it right. But if you keep doing the same thing over and over, hoping it’ll suddenly make sense—that’s on you. The trick isn’t to push harder; it’s to find a new teacher, a new explanation, a new way in.\n\nThat’s exactly how Matthew Broussard approaches comedy - and everything else. A stand-up comedian, math nerd, and former financial analyst, Matthew is obsessed with learning and cracking the formula behind how things work. He treats every joke like an equation, testing, refining, and solving for laughter.\n\nHe’s the creator of Monday Punday, a puzzle webcomic and app, and has been featured on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Conan, and Comedy Central’s Roast Battle. He’s also made appearances on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Mindy Project. His storytelling, including his viral tales about his mother-in-law, proves that logic and vulnerability can live in the same sentence.\n\nIn this episode, we explore the overlap between comedy and leadership—the art of experimenting, iterating, and connecting through honesty. We talk about the hidden work beneath success, the difference between purpose and perfection, and why laughter might just be the purest form of optimism.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by the Porsche USA Macan\n---------------------------\n\nCheck out Matthew’s Youtube page for his full comedy special “Hyperbolic”: @mondaypunday \n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "I’ve long imagined a world where people wake each morning inspired, feel safe wherever they work, and return home fulfilled by what they’ve created. That vision once felt like a dream—until I met Bob Chapman, CEO of Barry-Wehmiller, who quietly built it into reality. Over five decades, Bob has grown a humble Midwestern manufacturing company into a global business success story, proving that leadership grounded in humanity can scale across the world.\n\nBob sees the people in his company not as line items, but as human beings within his span of care—individuals he feels responsible to help become healthy, fulfilled, and whole. His belief is simple yet profound: when people are cared for at work, they create happier families, stronger communities, and a better world. He captured this vision in his book \"Everybody Matters\"—which I’m proud to have published—inspiring leaders everywhere to imagine a kinder form of capitalism.\n\nIn this episode, we return to BW Papersystems in Phillips, Wisconsin, where Bob first brought me fifteen years ago, where he showed me what his Truly Human Leadership movement looks like. There, I speak with Amber Meyers, Randall Fleming, Lance Johnson, and Jared Nelson, each at different points in their journey with Barry-Wehmiller—some just three years in, others more than twenty-five. Through their eyes, we see the company’s evolution and the lasting power of care in action. What I once thought was idealism, I now know is possible: proof that capitalism can, in fact, be kind.\n\nThis Is A Bit of Optimism. \n\nFor more of Bob’s work check out: \nEverybody Matters: https://www.barrywehmiller.com/bobchapman/book\nChapman & Co.

But it might be the perfect place to study it. Few industries move faster or cast people aside more quickly, and yet Rob Lowe has spent more than four decades defying those odds. His story isn’t just about surviving fame—it’s about overcoming adversity, finding joy in the work, and proving that authenticity is the only path to a career that lasts.\n\nAcross his career, Rob has navigated the highs of teen idol stardom, the lows of very public failures, and the challenge of reinventing himself again and again—all while staying relevant and true to himself. His secret? A willingness to take risks, embrace failure, and laugh at himself along the way.\n\nRob and I dive into Rob’s philosophy of resilience, authenticity, and joy. He shares how humiliations turned into lessons, why not taking yourself too seriously is a strength, and how authenticity has become the ultimate currency in today’s culture.\n\nYou can also see Rob hosting the fourth season of The Floor, airing September 24th on FOX.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism. \n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

Marriage, family, and even the workplace have all been reshaped by shifting norms, new technologies, and rising expectations. Happiness, once a nice-to-have, is now the very glue that keeps both couples and teams together.\n\nFew people understand these changes better than Esther Perel. For decades, she’s helped us rethink intimacy, navigate conflict, and reimagine what a healthy connection looks like—at home and now at work with her new conversation inducing game of questions, Where Should We Begin? At Work. \n\nEsther and I explore how our ideas of love and partnership have evolved, why friendships can be just as life-giving as romance, and why learning to “talk to strangers” may be the most important skill for the next generation. We also dive into the role of play, trust, and risk-taking in building lasting bonds.\n\nIf you care about creating relationships that are strong enough to withstand the pressures of modern life, this episode might just be for you.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\nTo learn more about Esther’s work, visit: \nhttps://www.estherperel.com/\n\nAnd check out \"Where Should We Begin?

But his insights come not just from research, but from a life of reinvention: from French horn player to scholar, from think-tank leader to teacher, and even pilgrim on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nIn this conversation, we explore why so many of us feel unhappy today, the real equation for joy, and why following your gut is essential. Along the way, Arthur shares how to treat life like a pilgrimage, why AI may strip away the struggle that makes us wise, and why the process - not the outcome - is where happiness lives.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered whether you’re “falling behind,” or if you’re searching for the courage to trust your instincts, this episode will remind you that happiness isn’t something you chase - it’s something you practice, every step of the way.\n\nThis is…A Bit of Optimism.\n\nCheck out more of Arthur’s work here: https://www.arthurbrooks.com/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "“Nuclear” might make you wince—but the real problem isn’t the energy, it’s the branding. Safe, low-carbon, and scalable, nuclear could be a climate hero—if only we told the story right.\n\nIsabelle Boemeke is on a mission to change how we think about nuclear energy. A Brazilian model turned the world’s first nuclear influencer, she created her alter ego, Isodope, to show a new generation the benefits of clean energy—while cutting through the fear shaped by war movies and disaster shows. In her new book, Rad Future, she makes the science, history, and promise of nuclear power accessible to everyone.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about why nuclear scares us, how we need to rethink the climate conversation, and why embracing nuclear energy could be one of our smartest moves yet. Isabelle also shares her personal journey—from modeling to advocacy, building Isodope, and helping shift the conversation around clean energy for a better, brighter future.\n\nThis is… A Bit of Optimism. \n\nLearn more about Isabelle’s work here: https://isodope.com/\nAnd order the new book \"Rad Future\" here: https://isodope.com/rad-future/ \n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by True Classic!\nI really love their T-shirts, so we called them up and asked if they wanted to work together.

      "description": "We’re wired to chase the next spark—scrolling, swiping, refreshing—but some of our brightest ideas sneak in when we stop chasing, let boredom settle in, and give our minds room to wander.\n\nElle Cordova knows the power of that pause. When the pandemic hit pause on her life as a touring musician, she stumbled into new creative territory—making offbeat comedy videos about delightfully nerdy topics like particle physics, grammar, and fonts. Those sketches went viral, and suddenly she was thriving as a social media creator with a devoted following. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about finding what truly lights you up, pushing through writer’s block, working with anxiety—and yes, Star Wars makes an appearance (because of course it does).

      "description": "This was the most epic Zoom call we’ve ever been a part of — an incredible conversation with NASA astronaut Jonny Kim, live from the International Space Station, with sunrise on Earth as a stunningly causal site behind him as they barreled at 17,000 mph in orbit. Thanks to the amazing team at Johnson Space Center, Jonny was able to join us to share insights from a life that defies limits, showing what it truly means to lead and serve on and off the planet.\n\nIn this episode, we grapple with a startling and powerful idea: that there can be a privilege in how we face our darkest days. For those who find the strength to rise through empathy and courage, adversity transforms from a burden into a source of profound growth and resilience. Jonny’s journey—from a violent childhood to becoming a Navy SEAL, Harvard-trained doctor, and astronaut—embodies this truth. \n\nDriven not just by pain or pride in loved ones, but by a genuine ambition to become his best self, Jonny’s story challenges us all to embrace hardship as a catalyst for leadership and service. This is a conversation the 13-year-old Simon, in his blue jumpsuit, would be very proud of. \n\nThis is… A Bit of Optimism. \n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by True Classic!\nI really love their T-shirts, so we called them up and asked if they wanted to work together.

In 2018, a breast cancer diagnosis forced her to get honest with herself. If Angela had only 2 years to live, what kind of life did she truly wish to live? Angela chose to start over. She sold everything she owned, left her acting career behind, and moved to New York to become a dance teacher. Angela's irreverent teaching style and unique approach to dance won her accolades, and she now teaches sold out classes where people use dance to find themselves.\n\nIn this conversation, Angela explains why cancer actually helped her become a better version of herself. She shares how her disease enabled her to adopt a 2-years outlook on life, and why living as if our time is limited is always good practice, even when nothing appears to be wrong.\n\nThis…is A Bit of Optimism.\n\nFor more on Angela and her work, check out:\nhttps://angelatrimburdance.com/\n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by True Classic!\nI really love their T-shirts, so we called them up and asked if they wanted to work together.

And in 2024, his commencement speech at the University of Michigan went viral for its simple, powerful message—to shock the world, unleash your kindness. \n\nIn this conversation, Brad tells me how his journey from a writer drowning in debt to bestselling author would not have been possible without the extraordinary kindness of a few ordinary strangers. He shares how other people’s negativity can become inspiration, why fictional heroes inspire us so much, and how ordinary people change the world.\n\nThis…is A Bit of Optimism.\n\nFor more on Brad and his work, check out:\n@meltzervideos \nhis book: https://bradmeltzer.com/Nonfiction/makemagic\nhttps://bradmeltzer.com/\n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by True Classic!\nI really love their T-shirts, so we called them up and asked if they wanted to work together.

She’s obsessed with helping people create lives worth living. A professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business, Suzy teaches a popular class called “Becoming You,” where she takes students down a brutal, but liberating, journey to live as their authentic selves. According to Suzy’s research, purpose is the key to unlocking the real you, but finding that purpose is often trickier than we imagine.\n\nI had a blast talking, and debating, with Suzy about what it means to craft a purpose-driven life. In this conversation, she shares with me the difference between passion and aptitude, the reason luck is overrated, and why so many people struggle to know their own values.\n\nTo learn more about Suzy and her work, check out:\nher book, https://www.suzywelch.com/books/\nand https://www.suzywelch.com/podcasts/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

People were desperate for clear, reliable information—unsure of evacuation routes or how to track the fires as they spread in a history-making windstorm. Then, we found Watch Duty. This intuitive app became our lifeline.\n\nThe visionary behind the app is John Mills, a seasoned tech entrepreneur who created Watch Duty out of necessity after his own community in Northern California was repeatedly threatened by deadly wildfires. But John didn’t just build an app—he reimagined how business and philanthropy can intersect to solve real-world problems.\n\nWatch Duty is a not-for-profit initiative that harnesses the power of technology and human talent, relying on volunteers to gather critical data from fire scanners and reporters to save lives. Despite its explosive growth, John has no plans to sell the app, because for him, the value isn’t in making money—it’s in using his skills to help others. In a world where many focus on getting rich, John is challenging us to rethink how we can use our talents to serve the greater good.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\nFor more on John and his work, check out:\nhttps://www.watchduty.org/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

Mark is one of the leading voices in the functional medicine movement, which is all about taking a holistic approach to our health for natural healing and preventing disease. The smallest changes in our daily lifestyle habits, or what we eat and drink, or our positive social interactions can have huge impacts on our long-term health.\n\nI sat down with Mark to talk about my most recent obsession – friendship. I was eager to get a physician’s perspective on all the ways friendship is beneficial for our health. In this conversation, we discuss the biological benefits of talking to a good friend and why you’re only as healthy as your five closest friends.\n\nThis…is A Bit of Optimism\n\nFor more on Mark Hyman and his work, check out:\nHis podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d/id1382804627\n\nhttps://www.functionhealth.com/\n\nhttp://drhyman.com/\n\n⏰ Timestamps\n0:00 The connection between health and friendship\n5:50 Your 5 closest friends determine your health\n11:37 Unhealthy relationships can spread disease\n16:01 Simon’s theory on the supplements industry\n23:10 Back to friendship / Loneliness is a big killer\n30:46 Finding and keeping close friends\n38:34 Longevity versus happiness\n43:49 How do we start making friends?\n47:20 Simon’s goals for his friendship book\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

After 15 years building Reddit into a social media juggernaut, why leave?\n\nThe answer is values. Alexis is the kind of entrepreneur and investor who believes that integrity and long term profits go hand in hand. It’s the reason he started his new company 776, allowing him to invest in startups that are trying to make the world a better place. And it’s the reason he resigned from Reddit after the George Floyd was killed, requesting the board replace him with a Black director.\n\nIn this conversation, Alexis shares with me his thoughts on the future of entrepreneurship, the race for AGI, climate change, and the principles that guide the way he leads.

      "description": "Seven years after ISIS killed her son, Diane Foley met with one of his killers. Somehow, she was able to find the humanity in her son’s murderer.\n\nISIS held journalist James Foley hostage for 2 years before publicly executing him in 2014. After her son’s murder, Diane Foley started The Foley Foundation, working to free American hostages held abroad, teach journalist safety, and inspire people to act with moral courage. \n\nI asked Diane how she found the moral courage to meet an ISIS terrorist and see him as a human being. If Diane could find the grace to connect with her son’s murderer, the rest of us can find the moral courage to see the good in those with whom we so vehemently disagree.\n\nThis is… A Bit of Optimism.\n\nTo learn more about Diane and her work, check out:\nher book: https://etruscanpress.org/product/american-mother-by-by-colum-mccann-with-diane-foley/\nhttps://jamesfoleyfoundation.org/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.
