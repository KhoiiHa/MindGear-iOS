      "title": "Rob Lowe Names Names: The Power of ‘Screw It’ | A Bit of Optimism Podcast",
      "description": "Hey Optimists! \nWe’re taking a little hiatus, but exciting things are coming your way! We’ll be back on October 21 with some amazing new episodes that we can’t wait to share. In the meantime, take care of yourself, enjoy the little moments, and remember—good things are just around the corner.\nSee you soon!\n—Team Simon\n\n+ + + \n\nWe don’t usually look to Hollywood for lessons in career longevity. But it might be the perfect place to study it. Few industries move faster or cast people aside more quickly, and yet Rob Lowe has spent more than four decades defying those odds. His story isn’t just about surviving fame—it’s about overcoming adversity, finding joy in the work, and proving that authenticity is the only path to a career that lasts.\n\nAcross his career, Rob has navigated the highs of teen idol stardom, the lows of very public failures, and the challenge of reinventing himself again and again—all while staying relevant and true to himself. His secret? A willingness to take risks, embrace failure, and laugh at himself along the way.\n\nRob and I dive into Rob’s philosophy of resilience, authenticity, and joy. He shares how humiliations turned into lessons, why not taking yourself too seriously is a strength, and how authenticity has become the ultimate currency in today’s culture.\n\nYou can also see Rob hosting the fourth season of The Floor, airing September 24th on FOX.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism. \n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist. He believes in a bright future and our ability to build it together. \n\nDescribed as “a visionary thinker with a rare intellect,” Simon has devoted his professional life to help advance a vision of the world that does not yet exist; a world in which the vast majority of people wake up every single morning inspired, feel safe wherever they are and end the day fulfilled by the work that they do.\n\nSimon is the author of multiple best-selling books including Start With Why, Leaders Eat Last, Together is Better, and The Infinite Game.\n\n+ + +\n\nWebsite: http://simonsinek.com/\nLive Online Classes: https://simonsinek.com/classes/\nPodcast: http://apple.co/simonsinek\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/simonsinek/\nLinkedin: https://linkedin.com/in/simonsinek/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/simonsinek\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/simonsinek\n\nSimon’s books:\nThe Infinite Game: https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/\nStart With Why: https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/\nFind Your Why: https://simonsinek.com/books/find-your-why/\nLeaders Eat Last: https://simonsinek.com/books/leaders-eat-last/\nTogether is Better: https://simonsinek.com/books/together-is-better/\n\n+ + +\n\n#SimonSinek",

      "description": "The future is something we create, not just something that happens. To guide progress toward real good, we need bold, optimistic visions of what society can become.\n\nReid Hoffman makes the case for better science fiction - stories that don’t just entertain, but illuminate the futures we can strive for. As a serial entrepreneur and cofounder of LinkedIn, Reid brings a unique perspective on how storytelling shapes technology, society, and innovation. He argues that imagining optimistic futures is essential if we want to create them.\n\nIn this episode, we also explore how technology like AI is changing the way our brains work and how our faculties will evolve, why humanity has shifted from focusing on external threats to internal ones, and how optimism isn’t blind faith—it’s a clear-eyed strategy for shaping a better world.\n\nCheck out Reid’s new book here: https://www.superagency.ai/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "We’ve never had more freedom in our relationships—yet many of us feel more disconnected than ever. Marriage, family, and even the workplace have all been reshaped by shifting norms, new technologies, and rising expectations. Happiness, once a nice-to-have, is now the very glue that keeps both couples and teams together.\n\nFew people understand these changes better than Esther Perel. For decades, she’s helped us rethink intimacy, navigate conflict, and reimagine what a healthy connection looks like—at home and now at work with her new conversation inducing game of questions, Where Should We Begin? At Work. \n\nEsther and I explore how our ideas of love and partnership have evolved, why friendships can be just as life-giving as romance, and why learning to “talk to strangers” may be the most important skill for the next generation. We also dive into the role of play, trust, and risk-taking in building lasting bonds.\n\nIf you care about creating relationships that are strong enough to withstand the pressures of modern life, this episode might just be for you.\n\nThis is A Bit of Optimism.\n\nTo learn more about Esther’s work, visit: \nhttps://www.estherperel.com/\n\nAnd check out \"Where Should We Begin?

      "description": "Your instincts aren’t just whispers. They’re a compass pointing you toward the life you’re meant to live. But in a world obsessed with speed, metrics, and outcomes, most of us forget how to listen.\n\n@drarthurbrooks, bestselling author and Harvard Business School professor, teaches one of the most popular classes on happiness. But his insights come not just from research, but from a life of reinvention: from French horn player to scholar, from think-tank leader to teacher, and even pilgrim on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nIn this conversation, we explore why so many of us feel unhappy today, the real equation for joy, and why following your gut is essential. Along the way, Arthur shares how to treat life like a pilgrimage, why AI may strip away the struggle that makes us wise, and why the process - not the outcome - is where happiness lives.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered whether you’re “falling behind,” or if you’re searching for the courage to trust your instincts, this episode will remind you that happiness isn’t something you chase - it’s something you practice, every step of the way.\n\nThis is…A Bit of Optimism.\n\nCheck out more of Arthur’s work here: https://www.arthurbrooks.com/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.

      "description": "We’re often told to do more, move faster, and chase the next big trend—but some of the most remarkable successes come from narrowing your focus, obsessing over one thing, and truly understanding the people you’re serving. \n\n@BenFrancis knows this better than most.\n\nHe started Gymshark with nothing more than a sewing machine and a passion for making gym clothes that actually worked for him. From those humble beginnings, he built a billion-dollar brand—carefully, sustainably, and with a vision for a company that lasts 100 years, not just a flash in the pan. And yes, he’s still young, proving that you can dream big while thinking long term.\n\nRecorded at the very impressive Gymshark HQ in Birmingham, UK, this episode takes us inside the energy and culture that fuel the brand. We dive into Ben’s journey of obsession, experimentation, and relentless focus, exploring how to build something meaningful without having all the answers, learning from failures, and why understanding your customer is everything.

Safe, low-carbon, and scalable, nuclear could be a climate hero—if only we told the story right.\n\nIsabelle Boemeke is on a mission to change how we think about nuclear energy. A Brazilian model turned the world’s first nuclear influencer, she created her alter ego, Isodope, to show a new generation the benefits of clean energy—while cutting through the fear shaped by war movies and disaster shows. In her new book, Rad Future, she makes the science, history, and promise of nuclear power accessible to everyone.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about why nuclear scares us, how we need to rethink the climate conversation, and why embracing nuclear energy could be one of our smartest moves yet.

When the pandemic hit pause on her life as a touring musician, she stumbled into new creative territory—making offbeat comedy videos about delightfully nerdy topics like particle physics, grammar, and fonts. Those sketches went viral, and suddenly she was thriving as a social media creator with a devoted following. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about finding what truly lights you up, pushing through writer’s block, working with anxiety—and yes, Star Wars makes an appearance (because of course it does).

Thanks to the amazing team at Johnson Space Center, Jonny was able to join us to share insights from a life that defies limits, showing what it truly means to lead and serve on and off the planet.\n\nIn this episode, we grapple with a startling and powerful idea: that there can be a privilege in how we face our darkest days. For those who find the strength to rise through empathy and courage, adversity transforms from a burden into a source of profound growth and resilience. Jonny’s journey—from a violent childhood to becoming a Navy SEAL, Harvard-trained doctor, and astronaut—embodies this truth. \n\nDriven not just by pain or pride in loved ones, but by a genuine ambition to become his best self, Jonny’s story challenges us all to embrace hardship as a catalyst for leadership and service. This is a conversation the 13-year-old Simon, in his blue jumpsuit, would be very proud of. \n\nThis is… A Bit of Optimism. \n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by True Classic!\nI really love their T-shirts, so we called them up and asked if they wanted to work together.

      "description": "You have two years left to live. What would you do?\n\nThat's a real question Angela Trimbur had to answer. In 2018, a breast cancer diagnosis forced her to get honest with herself. If Angela had only 2 years to live, what kind of life did she truly wish to live? Angela chose to start over. She sold everything she owned, left her acting career behind, and moved to New York to become a dance teacher. Angela's irreverent teaching style and unique approach to dance won her accolades, and she now teaches sold out classes where people use dance to find themselves.\n\nIn this conversation, Angela explains why cancer actually helped her become a better version of herself. She shares how her disease enabled her to adopt a 2-years outlook on life, and why living as if our time is limited is always good practice, even when nothing appears to be wrong.\n\nThis…is A Bit of Optimism.\n\nFor more on Angela and her work, check out:\nhttps://angelatrimburdance.com/\n\n---------------------------\nThis episode is brought to you by True Classic!\nI really love their T-shirts, so we called them up and asked if they wanted to work together.

She’s obsessed with helping people create lives worth living. A professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business, Suzy teaches a popular class called “Becoming You,” where she takes students down a brutal, but liberating, journey to live as their authentic selves. According to Suzy’s research, purpose is the key to unlocking the real you, but finding that purpose is often trickier than we imagine.\n\nI had a blast talking, and debating, with Suzy about what it means to craft a purpose-driven life. In this conversation, she shares with me the difference between passion and aptitude, the reason luck is overrated, and why so many people struggle to know their own values.\n\nTo learn more about Suzy and her work, check out:\nher book, https://www.suzywelch.com/books/\nand https://www.suzywelch.com/podcasts/\n\n+ + +\n\nSimon is an unshakable optimist.
