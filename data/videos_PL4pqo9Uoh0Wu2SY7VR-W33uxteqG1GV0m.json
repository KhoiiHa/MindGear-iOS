This type of work is rewarding, but challenging. Between the fog of his past on the battlefield and exposing evil here at home, the light was hard for Shawn to see sometimes. It is in that darkness that God showed up. This episode is about Shawn's journey to Faith & Christ. It's a testimony we hope inspires you.\n\nIf you are struggling to find faith, we hope this episodes encourages you to look around and see that God is around you always.\n\n🚨↘️ Shawn Ryan Show Links ↙️🚨\nNewsletter  - https://shawnryanshow.com/pages/newsletter\nPatreon       - https://www.patreon.com/VigilanceElite\nApple           - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shawn-ryan-show/id1492492083\nSpotify         - https://open.spotify.com/show/5eodRZd3qR9VT1ip1wI7xQ?si=59f9d106e56a4509\nTikTok          - https://www.tiktok.com/@shawnryanshow\nInstagram    - https://www.instagram.com/shawnryan762\n\n#vigilanceelite #shawnryanshow \n\nShawn Ryan Show Sponsors:\nhttps://helixsleep.com/srs\nhttps://1stphorm.com/srs\nhttps://moinkbox.com/srs\nhttps://meetfabric.com/shawn\nhttps://betterhelp.com/shawn\nhttps://drinkhoist.com - USE CODE \"SHAWN\"\nhttps://mudwtr.com/shawn - USE CODE \"SHAWNMUD\"\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n04:17 - Where are my people?\n06:22 - People who helped (Justin Hughes, Eddie Penney, Sam Childers, Eli Crane, Kyle Morgan)\n08:43 - Shawn’s religious upbringing\n09:33 - Getting out of war and meeting Katie\n10:44 - Faith in war (Did you pray in war?)\n12:00 - Atheist in a fox hole\n13:34 - Spiritual men Shawn has met along the way\n15:35 - Call sign “Bong”\n16:51 - When did faith kick in?\n25:48 - Tyler Vargus\n26:31 - Covenant school shooting\n29:40 - Shawn’s friend Dan Cerillo\n30:55 - Justin Hughes gave me a book\n33:00 - The normalization of evil affecting Shawn’s perspective\n37:36 - Shawn and Katie talking about why Shawn was crying\n39:09 - Shawn talks about seeing a representation of his friend Gabe\n42:42 - Shawn and Dave Rutheford get into a heated discussion\n48:40 - Chinese spy balloon\n51:34 - Katie worried about Shawn and suicide\n1:03:06 - Feeling the pressure to not care about evil\n1:07:57 - A wise old air force veteran gives and intervention\n1:13:19 - Katie’s encouraging advice about God\n1:16:37 - Dan Cerillo’s daughter texts Shawn\n1:24:31 - Shawn sees a UAP (footage)\n1:27:42 - Reading the bible & talking with Eddie Penney\n1:31:44 - 444\n1:36:43 - Day to day difference in perspective\n1:41:16 - Shawn meeting Katie and observing her faith\n1:45:56 - Danny Dietz Memorial",
